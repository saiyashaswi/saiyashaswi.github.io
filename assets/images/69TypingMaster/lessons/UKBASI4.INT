Next you will learn the keys E and I, which you can find above the home row, on the "extension" row. Use your middle fingers to strike E and I. 

You will soon notice that when you reach for the E and I keys with your middle fingers, all other fingers automatically mimic their movement and straighten out a little bit. However, your fingers should return to the home row when you relax after pressing an extension row key. Pay attention to this movement and try to keep it as small as possible. 

Press Enter to begin.
