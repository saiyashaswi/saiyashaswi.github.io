Depending on your keyboard, there may be small bumps on the keys F and J or D and K. 

Most keyboards have these bumps to help you find the home row without having to look at the keyboard. Once you've placed your fingers on the home row, keep your wrists straight and fingers curled in a relaxed position but do not rest your hands anywhere. 

Press Enter with the little finger of your right hand.
