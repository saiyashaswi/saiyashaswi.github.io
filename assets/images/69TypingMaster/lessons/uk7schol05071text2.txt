Suave duck Charles makes a meal, fears a farce 
He simmers salami, fries rice, shreds salad, slices eggs 
He humidifies alfalfa seeds, grills fish, measures sugar 
As eve falls, famished familiars Frida, Virgil, Marie, Samuel, Ava, Charles share a massive meal 

Virgil, a rare Sahara sailfish, is avid admirer, marvels, values meal 

Magical, a miracle, murmurs Frida, a valid Maledives medusa 

Makes me feel alive, fumes Samuel, a cavalier academic mammal 

Amid successful meal, Charles serves lavish delicacies 
Jamaica camel Ava likes marmalade, ice cream, fudge 
If cream caramels are hard I shall scream, alarms Marie 
Caramels are ideal, Ava smiles, Marie is glad 
Rich fudge ice cream makes me feverish, flames Samuel 

Meal Charles made receives much deserved acclaim 
Magical, lavish delicacies charm all familiars 
Simmered salami sauce is a verified success 
Demure Charles gleams as ravished familiars drum glasses 

Charles is eager, shall amuse familiars, make meals all eves, use eggs, salami, ham, revived salad leaves, much fresh mackerel
