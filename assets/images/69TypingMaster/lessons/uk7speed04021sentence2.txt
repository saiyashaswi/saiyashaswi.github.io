Walter wore Wellingtons on wearisome wanderings. 

Oddly, Olivia offered others oats and onions. 

Willoughby and Wordsworth wished Windsor well. 

Ostentatious, outer outrider outraged Orangemen. 

While Walt washed weft, Wilma whitewashed walls. 

Oh, obtrusive onlookers overlooked our objections. 

Overdressed Ottomans ousted overbearing oysters. 

Wild William wants a wild whimsical willowy wafer. 

Otto obeyed an obligation of objecting oatmeal. 

Wistful Wilma watches Wallace write whodunits. 

Obdurate objector observed obstinate ontologists. 

Whimsical Walter winked and wooed wise witty Wilma.
