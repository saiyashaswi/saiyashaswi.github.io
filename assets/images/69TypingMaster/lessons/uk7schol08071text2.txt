William Weathers was a wordy workman, a mason 
William had many nicknames as he had many mates 
William was called Will, Willie, Wally, Wal and Wim 

One day Wal was working at a building site as usual 
He was enjoying himself as the weather was warm 
The brick walls grew higher as the work advanced 
Seeing the result of his work gave him satisfaction 
I just love being a mason, William said and grinned 

At noon, Will decided to have a short lunch break 
He went into a large food store to get some food 
The store seems to be full of folks, he murmured 
It will be hard to find anything among this throng 
However, the man dived into the crowd bravely 
He headed for the fruit desk as he loved bananas 
Finally, Wim managed to reach the banana desk 
He chose three big bananas and turned to leave 

Simultaneously, an old man grabbed his arms 
A thief, a thief, the man shouted in a loud voice 
Immediately, two guards came running to them 
I saw this man steal a banana, the old man said 
William said he had not stolen anything at all 
You have a banana in your bag, the man said 
That is true but I bought it yesterday, Wal said 
He had really forgotten a banana in his old bag 
Fortunately, Willie had a tag on the old banana 
The guards let him go and buy the new bananas
