Do not look at the keyboard when you type. Instead, try to learn the key positions and the correct finger movements from one key to another and back by heart. 

Focus on typing as smoothly and accurately as possible to achieve the best possible efficiency. Your typing will improve rapidly! 

Each time a new letter is introduced, the Typing Tutor will show you a graphic of the keyboard on the screen. Try to learn the position of the new keys from the picture on the screen and avoid looking at the actual keyboard. You will also see a green dot indicating which finger should press each key. 

Press Enter to begin. Remember to use the little finger of your right hand.
