How much is 25% from $100? $25. 
Molly got a 20% discount. Isn't that wonderful? 
Was it really -20% or was it as much as -35%? 
"4 chairs + 1 table = $1020 * ", advertised the banner. 
How strange! "What does * refer to", asked Tommy. 
The salesman told that * referred to the +Bonus card. 
With the +Bonus card, Tommy gets a 27% discount. 
What day is 12/25/2013? -- It is Christmas day! 
Today 10%, tomorrow 20%, and on Thursday 50% off! 
I am in lesson 12 out of 13 lessons. That's almost 100%. 
I've done +/- 96 exercises as there are 8 in each lesson. 
Each timed exercise lasts at least 3 minutes but most take 5-10 minutes. Lesson duration is usually 45 minutes. 
All in all, I have spent almost 540 minutes (12*45 minutes) typing. That's only 9 hours in 2 weeks. 
I started with "hunt and peck" typing with net speed 18 WPM and 85% accuracy. 
My target net speed was 30 WPM, that's 200 KMP. 
I wanted to reach 95% accuracy. 
After learning the positions of 26 letter keys, 10 number keys and almost 20 punctuation marks and special keys, I've exeeded my target speed by 15% and now type 35 Words per Minute! And my accuracy is not 95% but 98% -- that's great! 
After continuing to practice for another 2-4 weeks, I'm sure to reach 45 WPM. After 2 months... 60 WPM. That's a promise!
