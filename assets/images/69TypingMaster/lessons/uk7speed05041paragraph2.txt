A walking shadow, a poor player, that struts and frets his hour upon the stage, and then is heard no more. William Shakespeare. 

A reader who quarrels with postulates, who dislikes Hamlet because he does not believe that there are ghosts or that people speak in pentameters, clearly has no business in literature. Northrop Frye.
