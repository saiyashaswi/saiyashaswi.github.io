I got up at 6 a.m. today. 

Is it 37 or 38 Dunst Street? 

June 5 is Mia's birthday. 

We saw 44 monkeys in a tree. 

Typing numbers 3, 4, 7, and 8, is easy. 

Reaching 5 and 6 is not too difficult either. 

Did you call 555 3548? 

Could I have 4.5 lbs of potatoes, please? 

And 6 nice steaks topped with 8 slices of bacon. 

I see 4 cats and 5 dogs, maybe a 6th too. 

Please add 4 eggs and 3 cups of milk. 

It'll take 45 minutes to get there. 

I did 3 laps, Fred 6, and Leslie 8 laps. 

The movie starts in 7 minutes at 6:45 p.m.
