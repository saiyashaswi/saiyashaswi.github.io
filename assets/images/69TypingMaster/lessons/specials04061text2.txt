It's challenging to type sentences with * and # and ^ (numbers are much easier!).

An emoticon (sometimes called a smiley or a graemlin), is a sequence of printable characters such as :), ^-^, or : -) or a small image that is intended to represent a human facial expression and convey an emotion. 

The ^ symbol means exponent (to the power of). So, for example, 5^2 means 5*5 (=25) and 3.2^2 means 3.2*3.2 (=10.24). 

+ means plus, - means minus, / means divide, * means multiply. In most cases, you don't need to type the *. 

In mathematics braces are used to delimit sets. For example: E = {1, 2, 3, ..., 1000} or D = {red, white, blue}
