Fire ants are a common insect. They are found all throughout the Southeastern and Southwestern United States. They build large mounds and can inflict a painful sting. The most common type is the red imported fire ant. 

Red imported fire ants live in colonies. First, they nest in the ground. They are usually found wherever there is grass. However, some fire ants create nests in the walls of buildings. As they build the colony, they create a mound of dirt over the nest. The mound can grow up to eighteen inches high and over two feet wide. 

When you get bitten by a fire ant, you will feel a sharp pain and a burning at the site. Each sting will turn into an itchy blister over the next day. 

The fire ants' bite contains venom. This can cause the area to swell up quite a bit. You treat the bite the same way you treat a bee sting. Wash the area with soap and water. Rub the sting with a cotton ball soaked in vinegar and water. You can also hold an ice cube against it. Some people have an allergic reaction to fire ants. The symptoms are just like the ones from a bee sting. If you have any of these symptoms, see a doctor as soon as possible. 

The best way to avoid getting bitten is to avoid fire ants and their mounds. If you're near a mound, keep your shoes on. And don't ever poke at it or try to play with it. The ants are hostile, and they will attack.
