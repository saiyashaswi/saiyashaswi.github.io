The work of postmen and postwomen is important 
The work these post people do is full of adventures 
In my view, that is rather inspiring and challenging 
I am happy to have many post people as my friends 
They often tell me about adventures they have had 
Listen to this one, for instance, and laugh with me 

Once upon a time, there was a postman called Zac 
He was a quiet lad who was most times just quiet 
He did not speak with anybody he did not know 
However, Zac was very zealous in his profession 
He did his best and more and he was proud of it 
Maintaining his dignity was very important to him 

One day, Zac started his mail tour the normal way 
His postal zone consisted of five different streets 
On the two first streets his work was just routine 
At the fifth door of the third street it happened 
Zac slipped a bunch of letters through the hole 
As he opened the lid, however, a bug jumped out 

The man who owned the apartment travels a lot 
He had just come back from a journey in Africa 
With him there arrived also some African bugs 
One of them, a huge bug, then jumped on Zac 
The bug crawled inside his shirt and on his chest 

Many people were waiting for Zac at their doors 
So Zac could not and would not dig the bug out 
He finished his tour with the bug on his chest 
And he maintained his dignity quite well, too
