Teddy did it immediately 

Sally dislikes mathematics 

Macy greeted Tim heartily 

Mary milked all the camels 

Critics slated the recitals 

Mr Smith is a great teacher 

The film is a real tearjerker 

The kids imitated the cats 

Ted is eighty yet healthy 

He reserved the tickets yesterday 

Ted tickles ticklish Mary 

Therese uses a thesaurus 

Harry is a lucky traveller 

Thelma yelled at Harriet
