The Kingdom of the Lion 

The Lion was the king of all the animals in the field and the forest. He was not violent or cruel, but he was as just and gentle as a king should be. 

During his reign, he called for a gathering of all the animals to draw up conditions for an alliance. In this alliance, the Wolf and the Lamb, the Tiger and the Deer, the Dog and the Hare, would live together in perfect peace. The Hare said, "Oh, how I have longed to see this day. Now the weak shall take their place by the side of the strong without fear." Everyone agreed, but after the Hare said this, he ran for his life. After all, you cannot believe everything you hear. 

The Dog and the Shadow 

A Dog crossed a bridge over a stream with a piece of meat in his mouth. He saw his own shadow in the water and thought it was another dog. It looked like the dog had a piece of meat in its mouth double his own in size. He wanted the bigger piece. He had to have it. To get it, he let go of the piece in his own mouth and attacked the other dog, and as a result, he lost both pieces. He lost what was in the water because it was only a shadow, and he also lost his own because the stream swept it away.
