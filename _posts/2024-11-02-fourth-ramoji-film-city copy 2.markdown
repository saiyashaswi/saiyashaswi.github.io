# (About Ramoji Film City)<a name="introduction"></a>
Hi everyone now I am going to explain my trip to Ramoji Film City.
Ramoji Film city is 70km away from my home. And it took 2 hours to go there.
When i went to Ramoji film city first I got the tickets and took a bus and went inside.
Ramoji film city is a very large place. It had the Guinness world record that this park was the largest park in the world. (it is 1666 acres).
There were six places in Ramoji city and those places are:

Movie magic 

First place in Ramoji film city is Movie magic. It has many shows which represent the Bollywood dances.
It is a fun place to see shows, dances etc.

Eureka

Then we went to Eureka which also represented the some good shows like stunt show, opening ceremony,etc.
Eureka is a fun place to see stunt shows.
In the night they would keep a parade with songs and the people dancing.

# [The best show in Ramoji film city (Fort Frontier)]  <a name="paragraph1"></a>

My best show in Ramoji film city is Fort Frontier.
I like Fort Frontier show because the people in the show will act like Mexico bandits who search for treasure and the cops would fight with them.
The Fort Frontier show is located in the Eureka.
At the last they would shoot some fake Frontier currency. All the people would run and colect it.

# ATV(All Terrain Vehicle) <a name="subparagraph1"></a>

My best game in Ramoji Film city is ATV motorbike

I like it because it is fast as thrilling.
I would just press the accelerator and go very fast. Actually I am more faster than my slow brother.
The only problem with ATV was that it had very hard steering wheel and I can't go anywhere.
The instructer instructed me for two minutes and I drew myself.
There were different types of trackes likes rocky track, muddy track, plane track, etc.
I wanted to ride for some more time but the instructor said the time was over.
So I went to the other places sadly.

# Bahubali set<a name="bahubali100"></a>

The Bahubali set was amazing because it has many statues and fake machines.

There was a very big statue of Balaldeva.

Then again I saw a statue of very fierce bulls and I sat on it.
