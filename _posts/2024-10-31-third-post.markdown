## I too Had a dream-An autobiography of Dr.Verghese Kurien  <a name="paragraph1"></a>

 
 I wanna tell you about a very good book called "I too had a dream"
 It was written by the Milk man of India , the founder of Amul , starter of operation flood movement
 And he is none other than Dr.Verghese Kurien
 He helped the milk industry in India before and after the independence to flourish.

There was a time where the imports from the British, New Zealand, Denmark,etc were made for milk powder, baby food and many other stuff

But Kurien wanted India to stop these imports and also empower the farmers who were not cared.
In the 1930's India's major brand was Polson butter . This company did not take the milk of the farmer's cooperatives but had taken milk from bureucrats, middlemen who cheated the farmers.

This company refused the milk of the cows of farmers saying some random excuses
When Dr. kurien came reluctantly to Anand, one of the milk diaries of India 
He was depressed seeing the diffuculties of farmers and wanted to help
And he ended up creating Asia's largest milk products company Amul


This book is the autobiography of Dr.Kurien
This book clearly explains the difficulties of the cows, farmers, corruption of the government, initial difficulties of Amul company .
