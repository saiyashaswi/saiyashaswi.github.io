# Diary of a wimpy kid
Hi everyone 
Today I want to tell you about a nice book series I came across.
I bet that everyone has this series as there are more than 250 million series sold.
You'r right I am telling about the Diary of the Wimpy kid.
My dad ordered this book online as I saw popularity of the book.

This book is about the life of a Kid name **Greg Heffley** and his family .
This is also about the difficulties he faced in his school and how weird his friends are.
The particular book I ordered was about the snow days and the book name was **The Meltdown**.

The book was very Interesting and funny as it explained the antics did by Greg's friends in winter.
It had a lot of stuff about war tactics in forts, sledging,rivalry,sarcasm etc.

It could have been a lot more better, if the book was longer because,if you ask me because it only had 270 pages.
But compared to Roald dahl's books this book is almost same in funnyness.
This book is way shorter compared to most harry potter books .
