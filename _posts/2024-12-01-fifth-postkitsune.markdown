# About Wonderla <a name="introduction"></a>
Hi everybody, today I want to explain about my trip to Wonderla. 

Wonderla is around 50 Kilometres from my Home.
It is packed with thrilling rides which gave me a monster dose of adrenaline and entertainment.
Even though kinda far from my home, it is totally worth it.
There are so many rides like the roller coaster, maverick, The Equinox and even VR experience etc
In total there are around 61 exhilarating rides packed with fun and adrenaline

We thoroughly enjoyed our trip. We even boarded the giant wheel which is Wonderla iconic ride. This is around 150 meters above the ground. 
One rotation in giant wheel takes about 5 minutes, you can image the rotation speed. 

Later we started back to home after watching evening celebrations.
