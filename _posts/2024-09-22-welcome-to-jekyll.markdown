# Tubit AI
Hi everyone 
Today I want to tell you about a cool AI based youtube summarizer which I found.
The name of this Cool AI is Tubit AI AKA https://mylens.ai/
I tried playing with this AI (im not nursery) with this with some very funny questions
It Requires some information
1. Create an Account 
1. Copy and Paste the youtube Url or any youtube video url for which you wanna summarise
1. Press enter And have fun
 
I had a good sense of humour and copy pasted the link of Rickroll video from youtube 
the results are given below

It gave me a lot of information of the video 
Which I did not know that it was released in 1987 and hit top one in UK charts, it is still one of the most popular videos.
