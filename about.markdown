  **Namaste everyone I am 10 year old**
 *I am studying in FIITJEE world school. I enjoy playing games and  reading books 
  My favorite book series is Geronimo Stilton, the main character of the story is a writer who lives in mouse island. This series narrates about Geronimo Stilton facing many challenges.
 Among them, I particularly like a book named "The Kingdom Of Fantasy".
 I like this book because the main character Geronimo Stilton faces many challenges and fights like a warrior with witches and once he disgiused himself as a witch and fought.
   Thank you*
